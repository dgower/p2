In the spirit of agile, we are going to have another go at the puzzle as no correct answers were given. So we have taken your feedback and attempted to reword it to make it more clear.

Please send your answers to p2@thoughtworks.com and the best answer will win a P2 related prize!

Welcome to the first puzzle for 2014. This it is brought to you by Anand Krishnaswamy.

A city is divided into zones (shown in red, green, orange, lilac and blue in the picture below) by the municipal corporation. Each zone has a few garbage bins within its bounds (spread out as evenly as possible). Each zone (except the grey one) has a garbage collection truck assigned to it. This truck plies the designated zone and empties the bins therein. Each truck has the capacity of 9 bins. Surrounding the brightly coloured zones is a special zone (bounded by the black line & outside all the other zones) which is a "common-zone". Any truck can empty bins in this zone only when it has collected all the garbage in its designated zone. No truck is assigned the grey zone.

A garbage truck is paid 1 bitcoins per emptied bin and a bonus of 5 bitcoins for every bin after the 5th bin emptied.

Devise a solution for the garbage collection company to track, manage & setup accounting for their trucks & ensure that the city is garbage-free. Note that your elegant solution must scale to a city with, say, 10,000 bins.
